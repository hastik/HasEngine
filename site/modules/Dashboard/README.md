## Getting Started

Check out the [documentation](https://daun.github.io/processwire-dashboard/) to get started.

## Features

- **Multiple panel types available**<br>
  The module comes bundled with multiple panel types that should cover 80% of use cases.

- **Easy to extend**<br>
  Creating your own panels is easy: you can either render a template file or create your own panel types by creating a ProcessWire module.

- **Highly configurable**<br>
  You're free to customize panels in their size, position, title and layout. Panels can be grouped and nested to create whatever layout you need.

- **Configuration as Code**<br>
  All configuration is done as code. This meets two objectives: the dashboard config can be version-controlled and sensitive credentials are never stored in the database. You are free to supply the data any way you want, preferably using environment variables.
